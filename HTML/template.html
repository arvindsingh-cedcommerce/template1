        <div style="width: 48%; text-align: justify; float: left;">Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source
             code editor which runs on your desktop and is available 
             for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support
              for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem
               of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, 
               Python, PHP,Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and 
               Unity). Begin your journey with VS Code with these
                introductory videos. By default, VS Code auto-updates to new
                 versions, and collects usage data and crash report information.
                  You may opt out of these defaults by disabling them as
                   instructed below.
