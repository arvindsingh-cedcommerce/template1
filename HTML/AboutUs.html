        <h3>Sample Headline</h3>
        <p>An article is any member of a class of dedicated words that
             are used with noun phrases to mark the identifiability of
              the referents of the noun phrases. The category of 
              articles constitutes a part of speech. A definite article is
               an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite 
               articles such as English the are used to refer to a 
               particular member of a group. It may be something that the 
               speaker has already mentioned or it may be otherwise 
               something uniquely specified.
